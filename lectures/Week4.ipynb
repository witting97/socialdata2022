    "It turns out that `plotly` (which we used during Week 2) is not the only way of working with geo-data. There are many different ways to go about it. (The hard-core PhD and PostDoc researchers in my group simply use matplotlib, since that provides more control. For an example of that kind of thing, check out [this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python-e070374fe621).)\n",

    "> *Exercise 1.1*: A new take on geospatial data. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">A couple of weeks ago (Part 3 of Week 2), we worked with spacial data by using color-intensity of shapefiles to show the counts of certain crimes within those individual areas. Today, we look at studying geospatial data by plotting raw data points as well as heatmaps on top of actual maps.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * First start by plotting a map of San Francisco with a nice tight zoom. Simply use the command `folium.Map([lat, lon], zoom_start=13)`, where you'll have to look up San Francisco's longitude and latitude.\n",
    "> * Next, use the the coordinates for SF City Hall `37.77919, -122.41914` to indicate its location on the map with a nice, pop-up enabled maker. (In the screenshot below, I used the black & white Stamen tiles, because they look cool).\n",

You could, for example, choose June-July 2016, but you can choose anything you like - the main concern is to not have too many points as this uses a lot of memory and makes Folium behave non-optimally. \n",

You can spot it if you go to that year's [lecture 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/suneman/socialdataanalysis2016/blob/master/lectures/Week3.ipynb), exercise 4.)"

    "We started the course by plotting simple histogram and bar plots that showed a lot of cool patterns.
