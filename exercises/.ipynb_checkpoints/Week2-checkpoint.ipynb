    "## Part 1: A little visualization exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by downloading these four datasets: [Data 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2022/main/files/data1.tsv), [Data 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2022/main/files/data2.tsv), [Data 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2022/main/files/data3.tsv), and [Data 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2022/main/files/data4.tsv). The format is `.tsv`, which stands for _tab separated values_. \n",
    "As you will later realize, these are famous datasets!\n",
    "Each file has two columns (separated using the tab character). The first column is $x$-values, and the second column is $y$-values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's ok to just download these files to disk by right-clicking on each one, but if you use Python and `urllib` or `urllib2` to get them, I'll really be impressed. If you don't know how to do that, I recommend opening up Google and typing \"download file using Python\" or something like that. When interpreting the search results remember that _stackoverflow_ is your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Exercise 1.1*: \n",
    "> \n",
    "> * Using the `numpy` function `mean`, calculate the mean of both $x$-values and $y$-values for each dataset. \n",
    ">      * Use python string formatting to print precisely two decimal places of these results to the output cell. Check out [this _stackoverflow_ page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8885663/how-to-format-a-floating-number-to-fixed-width-in-python) for help with the string formatting. \n",
    "> * Now calculate the variance for all of the various sets of $x$- and $y$-values, by using the `numpy` function `var`. Print it to three decimal places.\n",
    "> * Use `numpy` to calculate the [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) between $x$- and $y$-values for all four data sets (also print to three decimal places).\n",
    "> * The next step is use _linear regression_ to fit a straight line $f(x) = a x + b$ through each dataset and report $a$ and $b$ (to two decimal places). An easy way to fit a straight line in Python is using `scipy`'s `linregress`. It works like this\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> from scipy import stats\n",
    "> slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(x,y)\n",
    ">```\n",
    "> * Comment on the results from the previous steps. What do you observe? \n",
    "> * Finally, it's time to plot the four datasets using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Use a two-by-two [`subplot`](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/subplot_demo.html) to put all of the plots nicely in a grid and use the same $x$ and $y$ range for all four plots. And include the linear fit in all four plots. (To get a sense of what I think the plot should look like, you can take a look at my version [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdata2022/main/files/anscombe.png).)\n",
    "> * Explain - in your own words - what you think my point with this exercise is (see below for tips on this).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Get more insight in the ideas behind this exercise by reading [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). Here you can also get an explanation of why the datasets are actually famous - I mean they have their own Wikipedia page!!\n",
    "\n",
    "And the video below generalizes in the coolest way imaginable. It's a treat, but don't watch it until **after** you've done the exercises - and read the Wikipedia page. **Note:** Uncomment the line in the cell below to watch the video!"

    "The purpose of the exercise is to illustrate the importance of both creating plots/visualizing data and computing statistical measures to perform a proper analysis of datasets. Only judging the datasets from the numbers, they seem to be identical and thus similar conclusions can be made. Visualizing them shows that the datasets actually are vastly different from each other."
